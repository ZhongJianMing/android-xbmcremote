#labels Featured

As reported in [http://code.google.com/p/android-xbmcremote/issues/detail?id=136 issue 136] Key repeats in remote control mode can be pretty fast.

=== Fix/Workaround ===


  * create advancedsettings.xml in your userdata folder (where also guisettings.xml is located)
  * edit its content:

{{{
<advancedsettings>
    <services>
    	<esinitialdelay>750</esinitialdelay>
    	<escontinuousdelay>25</escontinuousdelay>
    </services>
</advancedsettings>
}}}
  * the values above are the default values. Change how you like.
